# ðŸ“Š explorica â€” A Flexible Framework for Exploratory Data Analysis

 **Current version:** 0.0.1 (pre-release)  

**explorica** is a modular and extensible Python framework for **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.  
It provides ready-to-use components for **data preprocessing, feature engineering, statistical analysis, and visualization**, allowing analysts and data scientists to focus on insights instead of boilerplate code.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Integrate Continuous Integration (CI) for automated testing and linting
- [ ] Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
- [ ] Create DataQualityHandler module combining preprocessing, outlier handling, and feature engineering
- [ ] Prepare demonstration notebooks for release branch

## ðŸ›  Components

### Core Classes
- **`DataPreprocessor`** â€” handling missing values, type casting, basic transformations
- **`FeatureEngineer`** â€” creating, encoding, and transforming features
- **`InteractionAnalyzer`** â€” detecting and quantifying relationships between variables
- **`OutlierHandler`** â€” identifying and processing outliers
- **`DataVisualizer`** â€” generating ready-to-use plots for numeric and categorical data

### Design Principles
- **Modularity** â€” each component is independent and reusable
- **Extensibility** â€” easy to add custom logic without changing the core
- **Data-Agnostic** â€” works across domains, not tied to a specific dataset type


## ðŸš§ Development Status

This project is under active development and will grow iteratively.  
Itâ€™s part of my journey toward building better data understanding, research tools, and ML-ready pipelines.

## ðŸ’¬ Language

The main documentation and code are in English.  
Some commit messages and development notes may include Russian â€” these will be translated as the project approaches a stable release.
